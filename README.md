# Tklib2
Tklib2 is an open-source Python library that aims to facilitate the creation of Python apps with GUIs.

Tklib2 is dedicated to the public domain under The Unlicense (https://unlicense.org/).
That means you can do essentially anything you want with it, but expressly grants **no warranty or liability whatsoever.**

## About Tklib2
Tklib2 packages different Tkinter components into simple functions, for example:
```python
import tklib2
tklib2.Label("Hello World")
tklib2.runApp()
```
While some people may find just using normal Tkinter syntax easier, this format has two goals:
1. In my opinion, it's a format that makes it easier to understand the code, not just know how to write it.
2. The 'building block' format of having each line (or function) being an element has a few benifits. For example, it makes it easier to represent the code graphically, either for teaching or for creating a block-based Python interface. 

## Tklib2 right now
At the time of writing, Tklib2 is still under heavy development. It is not recommended to be used in production, but if you'd like to accelerate the production launch to PyPi, feel free to contribute under the guidelines below.

As stated earlier, Tklib2 is under the public domain. Feel free to do anything with it (except 2 exceptions stated in the first section).

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to Tklib2, create a branch / virtual enviroment / etc. and make your changes. Then fire up a PR and wait for the commit.
